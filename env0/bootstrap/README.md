# START HERE
This bootstrap main.tf attempts to create the aws credentials to start using env0 with AWS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You must supply the following keys / tokens the first time to get started.
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - this will allow env0 to bootstrap the env0 assume role; going forward after the bootstrap process - you can utilize the assume role for all future deployments.

* ENV0_API_KEY / ENV0_API_SECRET - this will allow env0 to bootstrap the assume role into the env0 UI.

### What else does the Bootstrap process do?
